## About

Running the `npx` script above should create a Next.js dashboard built using:

-   [next-dashboard](https://github.com/accretence/next-dashboard) for the boilerplate repository the `npx` script clones
-   [geist-ui](https://github.com/geist-org/geist-ui) which adheres to the design language of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
-   [react-dashboard-design](https://github.com/ofekashery/react-dashboard-design) as inspiration and much of the initial codebase
